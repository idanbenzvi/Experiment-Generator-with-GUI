## A) ABOUT

This is version 0.4.1+ of Class Inheritance Browser, originally released @ http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27633.

This tool searches a given directory and populates a browser window with pertinent information about each discovered class, including properties, methods, and superclasses. Other useful features include opening a class definition file from the browser window, opening a file to the line where a certain method is defined, and printing property help to the console.

Additionally, if the Bioinformatics Toolbox is installed, a tree diagram will be displayed that visualizes inheritance relationships between all Matlab classes found.

Originally written as a project for Engineering 177, Advanced Matlab Programming, Spring 2010, Professor Andrew Packard, University of California, Berkeley.
